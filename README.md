The basemap is based off of the light base map provided by [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). I decided to go with a valentines theme using the colorpalette from [Color Pallets](http://colorpalettes.net/color-palette-1902/) using palette #1902. I chose to keep the basemap white while changing the colors of the buildings, roads, and water features. You will also find a color change between roads and highways since I wanted to show a separation between the two. Overall, the base map follows a simplistic twist on a basic basemap to add a little holiday flare to a map.
